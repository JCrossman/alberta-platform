# Alberta Open Data Intelligence Platform - Project Summary

## 📋 Executive Summary

**Project Name**: Alberta Open Data Intelligence Platform  
**Owner**: Jeremy Crossman (jcrossman@microsoft.com)  
**Duration**: 20 weeks (5 months)  
**Budget**: $800-2,200/month  
**Status**: Planning Phase ✅

## 🎯 Project Goals

### Learning Objectives
Master four key Azure services through hands-on implementation:
1. **Microsoft Fabric** - Unified data platform
2. **Microsoft Purview** - Data governance & compliance
3. **Azure AI Foundry** - AI model development & deployment
4. **Copilot Studio** - Low-code conversational AI

### Business Objectives
Create a compelling demonstration platform that shows Government of Alberta customers how to:
- Unify siloed data sources
- Implement comprehensive data governance
- Build predictive AI models for better decision-making
- Deliver 24/7 citizen services via AI chatbot
- Ensure compliance and security

## 🏗️ What You're Building

### Use Case 1: Healthcare Intelligence
- **Problem**: Emergency departments don't know when to expect high patient volumes
- **Solution**: AI predicts wait times 48 hours in advance using historical data
- **Value**: Better resource allocation, reduced patient wait times

### Use Case 2: Environmental Monitoring
- **Problem**: Manual monitoring of air/water quality is slow and reactive
- **Solution**: Real-time monitoring with AI-powered anomaly detection and forecasting
- **Value**: Faster incident response, public health protection

### Use Case 3: Citizen Service Chatbot
- **Problem**: Citizens can only get help during business hours, call centers overwhelmed
- **Solution**: 24/7 AI chatbot that answers questions about government services
- **Value**: Improved citizen satisfaction, reduced call center costs

### Use Case 4: Data Governance
- **Problem**: Don't know what data exists, where it came from, or who can access it
- **Solution**: Automated data cataloging, classification, lineage, and access control
- **Value**: Reduced compliance risk, faster data discovery, trusted data
